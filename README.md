The dataset contains information on bookings for two hotels in Portugal (a resort and a city hotel) scheduled to arrive in a period between July 1, 2015 and August31, 2017.

For both hotels, the same information was collected: 31 variables describing 40,060 observations for the resort and 79,330 observations for the city hotel. That is,the dataset contains information on 119,390 hotel reservations, including those that were canceled. This is real information, so all elements that could identify hotelsor customers were removed.

1. What is the month with the most guest arrivals?
2. How long do guests tend to stay at the hotel?
